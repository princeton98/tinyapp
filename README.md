# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This project was done in under four days, where we learned all about Express and began exploring encryptions and hashing programs. Using many of the tools learned earlier in the bootcamp, the project helped cement the tools that were introduced in the earlier weeks, and further enhanced my understanding in the process of web-development, and coding in general.
